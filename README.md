# Object-Oriented Drawing Application

This project is an object-oriented drawing application that allows users to create their own artwork by drawing lines. By clicking the mouse at the desired start and end points on a pop-up window, users can freely create lines to develop unique drawings. The application leverages object-oriented principles to organize and manage the drawing logic efficiently.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive user interface for line drawing
- Use object-oriented principles for clear and maintainable code structure
- Real-time visual feedback as users draw lines

## Instructions

1. Click the mouse at the location where you want to start the line.
2. Move the mouse to the location where you want to end the line and click again.
3. Continue drawing lines to complete your artwork.

Feel free to explore the code to understand how object-oriented programming principles are applied in building this interactive drawing application.
